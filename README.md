# Climate-Control-Grow-Box

Many houseplants struggle to survive due to the indoor environmental conditions they are brought into, which often do not match their specific climate needs. Often times these plants which may not be native to the region even if they could benefit from the natural climate control of the new location by boeing planted outside often have to deal with the indoor environment where factors like too high or low humidity levels, excessive or lack of lighting, and water availability all contribute to a plants deteriorating ability to thrive or even the plants death.

The goal of this project was to design a box which could work as an indoor environment for plants.Our solution is to design a small climate controlled grow box that is designed with the space constraints of a typical residential home. This box will have the ability to regulate and modify the current humidity percentage, airflow through the enclosure, light intensity levels, along with watering amount. By controlling these variables we can create a better suited environment for the plant than that provided by the average interior climate for the plants being grown. We will do this by having Humidity Control, Lighting Control, Water Control, Power Control, and a Control Subsystem that will work together to create a small self contained climate.
